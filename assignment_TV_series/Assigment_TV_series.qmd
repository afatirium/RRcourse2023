# Description about *Seinfeld*
## Details about the show
# **Seinfeld** is an American television sitcom created by *Jerry Seinfeld* and *Larry David*. Seinfeld has been described by some as a "show about nothing", similar to the self-parodying "show within a show" of fourth-season episode "The Pilot". Jerry Seinfeld is the lead character and played as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly in an apartment block on New York City's Upper West Side, the show features a host of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, which include *George Costanza*, *Elaine Benes*, and *Cosmo Kramer*, who are portrayed by *Jason Alexander*, *Julia Louis-Dreyfus*, and *Michael Richards*, respectively.
